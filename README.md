### What I learned

For this challenge i wanted to make it dynamic,so i used [ipwhois](https://ipwho.is/) as a geolocation api
with moment and moment timezone libraries.
Since i've done this challenge with figma file it was a bit easier than some of earlier challenges i did where i only had an image to refer on.
The annoying thing for me was the colon centering i didn't manage to do, and globally i feel my html/css could probably be better.
